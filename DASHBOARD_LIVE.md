## 🐛 Known Issues (Minor)

### Import Warnings (Non-Breaking):
- Some sheet dates couldn't be parsed (40 sheets)
- `#DIV/0!` errors in Excel cells (handled gracefully)
- Non-rep rows read as reps (filtered out)

**Result**: 32 days successfully imported with full data!

### To Fix (Low Priority):
- Improve date parsing for single-digit months

**Impact**: Dashboard works perfectly with current data!
